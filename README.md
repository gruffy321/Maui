This repo holds a development for a local business hire firm.
They hire beach equipment and required a paperless shift to stay inclusive to their eco friendly ethos.
The app uses a local SQLite database to store the daily records and thisis sent off at the end off the day via email when z reading the app automatically.
The data is then transmogrified to an EXCEL spreadsheet format [.CSV] which is the format required by the company accountant for use in runnign the business.
The app is specifically designed for a fixed tablet size due to the known constraints of the device being used. 10.1" rugged Tablet by OUKITEL.
This is a live application and is ongoing with updates and changes that coincide with changes made by the company affecting the operation of the app/ its use by staff etc.

AS the project is ongoing, the current state is not uploaded to GH just yet, there is a viewable repo containing the full project in its early state but the MVVM paradigm is not demonstrated efectively here. However, it all works very well still if anyone would like the code - you will have to do a full project build as the debug and Bin children had to be removed for repo size reduction:)
